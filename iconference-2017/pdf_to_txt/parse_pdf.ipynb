      "manufacturing strategy that would excel their customers’ requirements as well as ensure \n",
      "company’s  growth  in  the  market.  A  manufacturing  strategy  is  a  plan  for  moving  from \n",
      "where  it  is  to  where  it  wants  to  be.  World-class  manufacturing  (WCM)  is  one  such \n",
      "strategy  which  helps  organisations  to  attain  their  desired  goals  because  it  is  not  just \n",
      "confined to a particular area but focuses on the organisation as a whole. \n",
      "\n",
      "The  term  ‘WCM’  was  coined  by  Hayes  and  Wheelwright  (1984)  to  describe \n",
      "organisations  that  achieved  a  global  competitive  advantage  through  the  use  of  their \n",
      "manufacturing  capabilities  as  a  strategic  weapon.  It  is  a  subset  of  ‘best  practices’ \n",
      "paradigm of operations strategy (Voss, 1995). It refers to being the best organisation in \n",
      "one’s  particular  sector  of  industry  (Todd,  1995).  Oliver  et  al.  (1994)  explained  that  to \n",
      "qualify as world class, a plant had to demonstrate outstanding performance on measures \n",
      "of both productivity and quality. WCM requires an overall willingness to establish closer \n",
      "connections  with  everyone  from  customers  and  suppliers  to  workers;  an  unwavering \n",
      "commitment  to  self-analysis  and  improvement;  and  an  aggressive  approach  to \n",
      "technologies that can help turn visionary strategies into gold-medal realities. It has often \n",
      "been characterised by three core strategies of customer focus; quality; and agility; and six \n",

      "product development;  environmental  responsibility  and  employee  safety;  and  corporate \n",

      "\n",
      "During  the  past  few  decades,  research  on  WCM  attracted  attention  from  both \n",

      "The objective of this paper was to rank a set of case organisations based on their WCM \n",
      "practices.  For  this  purpose,  the  criteria  for  WCM  were  selected  through  literature. \n",
      "Secondly,  the  MCDM  algorithm  fuzzy  PROMETHEE  was  decided  upon  owing  to  its \n",
      "many  advantages.  To  test  this  framework,  the  heavy  engineering  sector  in  India  was \n",
      "targeted as engineering industry has witnessed an unprecedented growth in the past few \n",
      "years resulting from an increased investment in infrastructure development and industrial \n",
      "production.  Three  pioneer  companies  in  the  heavy  engineering  sector  were  studied.  A \n",
      "survey was made and the responses of the companies were recorded and evaluated by the \n",
      "decision makers. A detailed step-by-step fuzzy PROMETHEE algorithm was presented \n",
      "and from the extensive analysis, it can be concluded that company B is the best in WCM \n",
      "practices over company A and C. It is believed that this paper will provide an opportunity \n",
      "for the managers to understand the concept of fuzzy PROMETHEE and apply the same in \n",

      "Abstract—In this era of big data, as relational databases are inefﬁcient, NoSQL databases are a workable solution for data storage. In\n",
      "this context, one of the key issues is the veracity and therefore the data quality. Indeed, as with classic data, geospatial big data are\n",
      "generally fuzzy even though they are stored as crisp data (perfect data). Hence, if data are geospatial and fuzzy, additional\n",
      "complexities appear because of the complex syntax and semantic features of such data. The NoSQL databases do not offer strict data\n",
      "consistency. Therefore, new challenges are needed to be overcome to develop efﬁcient methods that simultaneously ensure the\n",
      "performance and the consistency in storing fuzzy geospatial big data. This paper presents a new methodology that tackles the storage\n",
      "issues and validates the fuzzy spatial entities’ consistency in a document-based NoSQL system. Consequently, ﬁrst, to better express\n",
      "the structure of fuzzy geospatial data in such a system, we present a logical model called Fuzzy GeoJSON schema. Second, for\n",

      "data are error-free. The system incorporates 10 different data\n",

      "nism by introducing the Fuzzy GeoJSON schema to perform\n",
      "the structure checking of the input fuzzy data. Therefore, we\n",

      "The storage time with varying data quantity progressively\n",

      "\n",
      "We deﬁne an additional validator on the collection level\n",
      "to perform the semantic checking. As seen in Fig 28, the\n",
      "storage and structure checking cost is more time-consuming\n",
      "than the semantic checking cost. The semantic checking\n",

      "\n",
      "The system gives the advantage of having a pre-storage\n",

      "therefore eliminating them. Given these cases, traditional\n",
      "data-handling approaches are inadequate. Therefore, the\n",
      "development of conceptual and methodological approaches\n",
      "based on fuzzy descriptive models is a needed solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.1 Fuzziness and Spatial Data\n",
      "To illustrate the importance of the fuzzy model in capturing\n",
      "imprecise borders, let us consider the case of airport bound-\n",
      "aries that are deﬁned by four systems: OpenDataSoft, IGN,\n",
      "ESRI, and GISCO. Fig. 30-(a) illustrates a representative\n",
      "comparison between datasets produced by these systems.\n",
      "All of them are presented on OpenStreetMap, one of the\n",

      "\n",
      "Displayed maps reveal clear differences in representing\n",
      "boundaries for the same airport areas (marked by red stars).\n",
      "Moreover, OpenDataSoft, IGN, ESRI, and GISCO are based\n",
      "on the GeoJSON model. Thus, they do not present bound-\n",
      "aries as a set of α-cuts, and they cannot detect wrong data or\n",
      "limits. They do not consider fuzzy geospatial types and do\n",
      "not deﬁne a fuzzy schema. These different limits show the\n",
